      | Course 1 | C1        | 1         |
      | Course 2 | C2        | 1         |
      | Course 3 | C3        | 2         |
      | Course 4 | C4        | 2         |
    Given the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname |
      | teacher  | T1        | Teacher  |
      | student  | S1        | Student  |
